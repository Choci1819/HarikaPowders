# Harika Millets Powders — Web Store (Dev)

This is a small demo React + TypeScript store showing millets, millet powders and rice powders with a WhatsApp checkout flow.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

WhatsApp checkout

- Edit `src/config.ts` to replace the `STORE_PHONE` with the WhatsApp number that will receive orders (use international format without `+`, e.g., `919876543210`).
- Add product images or update the sample URLs in `src/data/products.ts`.

Notes

- This project is scaffolded as a minimal demo; you can expand it with authentication, a backend, and payments later.
