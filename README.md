Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

WhatsApp checkout

- Edit `src/config.ts` to replace the `STORE_PHONE` with the WhatsApp number that will receive orders (use international format without `+`, e.g., `919876543210`).
- Add product images or update the sample URLs in `src/data/products.ts`.

Notes

- This project is scaffolded as a minimal demo; you can expand it with authentication, a backend, and payments later.
 

If you'd like the site to show your real attribution: open `src/config.ts` and update the `DEV_NAME`, `DEV_EMAIL`, and `DEV_WEBSITE` constants (these are shown in the site footer).
